# Digit-Recognizer
A model to detect handwrittendigits from images. This is a project based on the Kaggle Competetion "Digit Recognizer". I have built a strong image classification model using a Sequential model from Keras to classify handwritten digits. The images that I have used to train and test my model can be found at the following link. https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data
